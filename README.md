# Slackware-Tools
Various scripts that I have come up with to make Slackware a little easier.


installed_pkgs.sh - a tool to list the Slackware packages (base and 3rd party) on your system.  Helps when you need to wipe and reinstall everything.
	
sound_diag.sh - A diagnostic tool to check your sound configuration.  It doesn't fix anything but, it helps diagnose issues.
	
startx.select - A script to allow you to start various window managers on Slackware without having to change your system configuration.
